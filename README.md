# Quality-Auditing-App
## Introduction
Working in Operations Performance, we are responsible for supporting the operational customer service teams. An upcoming project involves helping the team of quality advisors in the process of reviewing customer calls. Currently, they carry out strict auditing using spreadsheets, which are then sent to our team to be manually added to our dashboards. This current system is inefficient and prone to errorsbecause it relies on users adhering to structured processes and validation rules. There are also issues with fragmented storage, quality advisors are required to send the spreadsheets to the Performance team for monitoring, as well as holding onto copies for auditing.

To resolve this, the team is aiming to transition to a centralised data collection solution, such as deploying a customised Google Form or an AppSheet application. The operational goal is to establish a standardised process for quality checks that sends data to a single location directly integrated with existing dashboards. This would enable automated, real-time performance analytics and more secure data handling.

This project will look at how a similar system could be set up using a Python-based application. By developing a functional prototype using Streamlit, this project models the core mechanics required for a real-world solution. It demonstrates how to transition away from unstructured spreadsheets by employing an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) that enforces input validation and ensures consistent data formatting. The application captures the audit criteria programmatically and writes the outcomes to persistent CSV storage. While the final production tool may utilise a low-code platform like AppSheet, building this Python program proves the underlying logic of the proposed workflow. It highlights how structuring data at the point of entry is crucial to advance our existing dashboards and analytics for our customer service teams.
